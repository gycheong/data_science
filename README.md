## Data Science

This repository contains codes and documents relevant to any general data science / data analytics that are not too specific about AI or ML (e.g., SQL, Data Visualization, pedagogical projects, etc). Currently, much of it comes from what I learned through the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Program](https://www.ibm.com/training/badge/data-science-professional-certificate), but it will expand over time.

### SQL (folder)
* **SQL vs Pandas.ipynb** solves 10 task prompts made by Lakshmi Holla from the IBM DS course above. Originally, the tasks are supposed to be done in SQL, but we also do them by Pandas so that they are comparable with answers in SQL. This material can be beneficial to any reader who is more fluent in Pandas than SQL.
