The task prompts are excerpted from Course 10 (capstone) of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Program](https://www.ibm.com/training/badge/data-science-professional-certificate) and they were written by Lakshmi Holla. The dataset we use is orignally from SpaceX, but the cleaned data is given by the IBM course."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["**Takeaway**. Reading this notebook should be most beneficial to someone who is comfortable using Pandas library in Python but wants to practice SQL. We use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), which is a fairly easy-to-use API that lets us write relational database queries in Python. We encourage the reader to find other SQL exercises with a csv file and make their own comparison sheet to enhance their masteries.
